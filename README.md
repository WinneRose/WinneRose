# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Burak Osman YaldÄ±z (WinneRose)

## ðŸ’« About Me:
I have been working in the software and design sector since I became aware of myself, and my childhood dream was actually to prepare myself for the worlds of tomorrow by researching and I aim to share these research and my work with people and expand my knowledge base.<br>In the software side, I have mostly worked as a front-end developer, but I also have sufficient knowledge on back-end development and I am preparing myself for newer technologies. I actively continue my research in product hunt and github to find and use these technologies.<br>In the design aspect, I try to create modern and eye-catching designs that appeal to people. In this direction, I actively use dribble and behance to get inspired, so that I can add a new perspective to myself.<br>
